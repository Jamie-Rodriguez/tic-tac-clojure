; Uses a modified version of Brian Kernighanâ€™s Algorithm.
; Instead of just counting the number of set bits, writes the set bits into a list.
; Uses the fact that n & (n-1) removes the *rightmost* SET bit from n
; Then use n XOR (n & (n-1)) to get the removed bit, and add it to the list
; e.g.:
;     input: 1101
;     output: [0001, 0100, 1000]
